list serve on google groups.  We encourage you to visit the group at

you have. You can also search the email archives there.  

You can also directly email the group at [codename] AT googlegroups.com.  For the benefit of future archive readers, if you
could please include a descriptive subject line of the issue you're
having, that would very helpful.

If a run crashes, it can oftentimes be very useful to post your
parameters files as well as include which hash you're working off of.
You can recover the hash by typing::

  >hg id

And similarly, if you want a neat way to create a link out of your
parameters files, you can type::

  >yt pastebin parameters_master.py
  >yt pastebin parmaeters_model.py

and two separate links will be created with the parameters files.

Welcome to Powderday's documentation!
=====================================
`powderday <https://github.com/dnarayanan/powderday.git>`_ is a dust
radiative transfer package designed to interface with galaxy formation
simulations in order to produce realistic spectral energy
distributions and images. The code utilizes `fsps <https://code.google.com/p/fsps/source/checkout>`_ (and its python
hooks, `python-fsps
<http://dan.iel.fm/python-fsps/current/installation/>`_) for stellar
SEDs, and `Hyperion <http://www.hyperion-rt.org>`_ for dust radiative
transfer.  Threaded throughout is `yt <http://yt-project.org>`_.

The code has two principle aims - to be flexible (and extremely
modular), and to be easy to use.  The package is written in python,
though makes use of fortran, C and cython.  

As of now, the code works Gadget (HDF5), Gizmo (HDF5), Gasoline
(tipsy), Changa (tipsy) and Arepo (HDF5).  Support for RAMSES, ART and Enzo are
in progress, as well as NCHILADA-formatted outputs.  The current timeline for a code paper is Fall 2019 (fingers crossed).

Finally, this code benefits from the contributions, either directly to
this software, or indirectly by contributions to dependency software,
by many astrophysicists, including Matt Turk, Tom Robitaille, Connor
McClellan, Ray Sharma, Robert Thompson, Charlie Conroy, Prerak Garg, Ben Johnson, Dan
Forman-Mackey and Phil Hopkins.

.. important:: **Disclaimer**:

   While the developers have made every effort to ensure
   that the code is bug-free, bugs invariably find their
   way in.  The developers are not responsible for
   incorrect results, arising either from inherent bugs
   in the code, or mistakes in usage.  Any questions
   regarding the code or usage should be sent to the
   mailing list.
